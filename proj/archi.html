    <h1>Architectural Engineering</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Architectural Engineering</span> blends science, engineering, and creativity to ensure that buildings are structurally sound, energy-efficient, and safe. Professionals in this field work closely with architects, construction experts, and designers to bring architectural concepts to life while focusing on engineering principles and sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Architectural Engineering</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design & Construction:</strong> Plan and engineer structural, electrical, and mechanical systems in buildings.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Focus on green buildings, energy efficiency, and eco-conscious design.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety & Compliance:</strong> Ensure adherence to local building codes and regulations.</li>
      <li><strong>Technology Use:</strong> Use design software and modeling tools to simulate and analyze structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Resolve design flaws, ensuring safety, efficiency, and functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Partner with architects, contractors, and engineers to deliver successful projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Salary Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entry-Level:</strong> ₹5 – ₹7 LPA</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-Level:</strong> ₹9 – ₹13 LPA</li>
      <li><strong>Senior-Level:</strong> ₹13 – ₹20 LPA or higher</li>
      <li><strong>Average Salary:</strong> Approx. ₹6,00,000 annually (varies by skill, location, and company)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scope of the Field</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Building Design & Construction:</strong> Plan and supervise the creation of buildings across sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Structural Integrity:</strong> Ensure durability against environmental factors like earthquakes and wind.</li>
      <li><strong>Systems Integration:</strong> Design HVAC, electrical, lighting, and other internal systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Retrofit & Renovation:</strong> Upgrade and modernize old buildings with sustainable solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Green Building Practices:</strong> Develop strategies for minimizing environmental impact and maximizing efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design Firms:</strong> Work on building concepts, models, and engineering calculations.</li>
      <li><strong>Construction Companies:</strong> Oversee real-world execution of engineered building plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Government/Public Sector:</strong> Contribute to urban planning and infrastructure development.</li>
      <li><strong>Consulting Firms:</strong> Advise on engineering feasibility, sustainability, and safety standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Freelance & Remote Roles:</strong> Offer flexibility and creativity in select sectors and project types.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Distinction from Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      While both <span class="highlight">Architecture</span> and <span class="highlight">Architectural Engineering</span> are building-focused disciplines, architecture leans toward aesthetics, space, and design philosophy, while architectural engineering concentrates on the technical integrity, structural efficiency, and environmental performance of buildings.
    </p>

    <h2>Factors Influencing Salary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Senior engineers earn significantly more due to project scale and leadership.</li>
      <li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Fields like sustainable design or smart buildings command premium pay.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Metropolitan areas and global firms offer better packages.</li>
      <li><strong>Qualification:</strong> Master’s or professional certifications can boost career growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Sector:</strong> Public vs. private and size of company influence salary scales.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In conclusion, <span class="highlight">Architectural Engineering</span> offers a powerful mix of technical knowledge and design application. It's ideal for those who enjoy creative problem-solving while making lasting contributions to our built environment.
