  <div class="container">
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Logistics</span> and <span class="highlight">Supply Chain Management</span> are distinct but interconnected fields. Logistics focuses on the efficient movement and storage of goods, services, and information within a company's operations, while supply chain management encompasses the entire network of companies that collaborate to bring a product to market, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the finished product to the customer.
    </p>

    <h2>Logistics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Internal Focus:</strong> Logistics primarily deals with activities within a single organization, such as managing inventory, warehousing, and transportation.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Functions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Inbound Logistics: Receiving raw materials and components from suppliers.</li>
          <li>Outbound Logistics: Delivering finished products to customers.</li>
          <li>Transportation: Moving goods between different points in the supply chain.</li>
          <li>Warehousing: Storing goods until they are needed.</li>
          <li>Inventory Management: Ensuring the right amount of inventory is available at the right time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To optimize internal processes and meet customer demands efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supply Chain Management (SCM)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>External and Internal:</strong> SCM goes beyond a single company and involves coordination with suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Components:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Planning: Developing strategies and plans for the entire supply chain.</li>
          <li>Sourcing: Selecting suppliers and negotiating contracts.</li>
          <li>Manufacturing: Producing goods.</li>
          <li>Delivery & Logistics: Moving goods to customers.</li>
          <li>Returning: Handling returns and reverse logistics.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To create a seamless and efficient flow of goods and services that meets customer needs and drives competitive advantage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Differences Between Logistics and Supply Chain Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Logistics focuses on a single company's internal operations, while SCM encompasses the entire network of companies involved in bringing a product to market.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Logistics focuses on optimizing specific functions within the supply chain, while SCM focuses on the overall integration and coordination of all supply chain activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Logistics: A company's internal warehousing operations.</li>
          <li>SCM: The entire process of a product being sourced, manufactured, transported, and delivered to the customer.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In essence: Logistics is a subset of supply chain management. SCM is the broader concept that includes all aspects of planning, sourcing, manufacturing, delivery, and returning, while logistics focuses on the movement and storage of goods within the supply chain.</p>
