    <h1>CPT - Curricular Practical Training</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">CPT</span>, or Curricular Practical Training, is a work authorization for F-1 visa students in the U.S. to gain practical experience in their field of study. It allows students to work in jobs, internships, or cooperative education programs related to their major. The salary and scope depend on the field of study, location, and experience, but generally, CPT positions offer opportunities for paid work and valuable practical experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Salary and Scope of CPT</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Salary:</strong> The salary for CPT positions varies widely depending on the field, location, and experience level. Entry-level CPT positions may offer lower hourly rates, while more specialized or experienced roles can command higher salaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> CPT positions can range from part-time to full-time work, depending on the specific program and employer. The scope of work can also vary greatly, from assisting with research projects to taking on more complex tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Salaries and job opportunities for CPT positions can vary significantly by location, with larger metropolitan areas and high-cost-of-living cities often offering higher salaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> CPT positions may offer benefits like paid time off, health insurance, and other perks, depending on the employer and position.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CPT and OPT</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">CPT</span> and <span class="highlight">OPT</span> are different types of work authorization for F-1 students. CPT is for students to gain practical experience in their field of study, while OPT is for students to seek employment after graduation. It is possible to apply for both CPT and OPT, but working full-time for 12 months on CPT can make a student ineligible for OPT.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples of CPT Salaries and Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Computer Science/Engineering:</strong> Salaries for CPT positions can range from around $25 to $50 per hour. Full-time OPT positions can offer salaries ranging from $70,000 to $130,000 per year.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Coding:</strong> Salaries for medical coders can range from $15,000 to $100,000 per month, depending on experience and location.</li>
      <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> The median salary for a CPT-certified penetration tester is $84,690. Experienced testers with 10 years of experience can earn around $119,328.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Curricular Practical Training for F-1 Students</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> CPT allows F-1 international students to gain practical experience in their field of study through internships, co-ops, or other work-related activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> CPT is typically available to F-1 students who have completed one full academic year of study at an SEVP-certified school, though graduate students may be eligible sooner if their program requires it.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> CPT can provide valuable work experience, help students apply their classroom knowledge, and potentially lead to future employment opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Students must have a job offer and a cooperative agreement with their school to participate in CPT.</li>
      <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> The Designated School Official (DSO) at the student's school must approve the CPT and issue a new I-20 form.</li>
      <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> If a student engages in 12 months or more of full-time CPT, they may be ineligible for OPT later on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Codes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> CPT codes are used by healthcare providers to report medical services and procedures for billing purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Development:</strong> The CPT code set is developed and maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA).</li>
      <li><strong>Importance:</strong> CPT codes help ensure accurate reporting of medical services, streamline claims processing, and support the development of medical care guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>Use:</strong> CPT codes are used across the country by various healthcare providers, insurance companies, and other organizations.</li>
    </ul>
