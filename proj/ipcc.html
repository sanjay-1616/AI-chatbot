  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">IPCC</span> (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) offers a range of opportunities for those involved in climate science, with salaries varying depending on experience and role. While the IPCC is not an employer in the traditional sense, individuals contribute to the panel's work through various roles and organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>Salary and Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IPCC as a Research Hub:</strong> The IPCC is a scientific body that provides assessments of climate science for policymakers, but it doesn't directly employ individuals. Instead, experts contribute to the IPCC's work through their affiliations with universities, research institutions, and governmental agencies.</li>
      <li><strong>Salary Range:</strong> Salaries for climate scientists in India generally range from ₹6 lakhs to ₹76 lakhs per year, depending on experience, skills, and the nature of the role. International companies also offer competitive salaries to Indian CAs, as stated by Vsmart Academy.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope and Career Growth:</strong> The IPCC's work significantly impacts climate policy, offering a rewarding career path for those interested in climate science. Opportunities for growth and specialization exist within research institutions, government agencies, and private sector companies involved in sustainable development and climate solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IPCC Activities</h2>
    <p>
      The IPCC organizes meetings, publishes reports, and manages a trust fund to support these activities. The IPCC's assessments are a key source of scientific information for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. The IPCC is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Aspects of the IPCC</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mandate:</strong> The IPCC's main goal is to assess the science related to climate change, its impacts, and future risks, as well as adaptation and mitigation options.</li>
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong> The IPCC has three working groups: the first focuses on the physical science basis of climate change, the second on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, and the third on mitigation.</li>
      <li><strong>Reports:</strong> The IPCC produces periodic assessment reports, special reports, and methodology reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Role in Policy:</strong> IPCC reports are a key input into international climate negotiations and provide governments with the scientific information they need to develop policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Funding:</strong> The IPCC is funded by regular contributions from its parent organizations, WMO and UNEP, and voluntary contributions from member governments.</li>
    </ul>
